This README is for Skeleton 1.0.0

Skeleton is a package that contains a simple but functional configuration
for autoconf, automake, libtool, and gettext.

Skeleton is developed and distributed in the hope that it will allow authors
of free software to use autoconf, automake, libtool, and gettext for their
package without going through boring and complicated setup steps. Just add new
files to the relevant Makefile.am.

This version of Skeleton contains everything needed to build a simple
program, skeleton. It has already been configured with autoconf and automake.
When make is invoked, skeleton will be built, along with the libtool library
libskeleton. Skeleton calls hello_world in libskeleton, which outputs a
greeting from libskeleton which is translated by gettext.

Also included in this package is a copy of the GNU General Public License,
the GNU Free Documentation License, and a standard disclaimer in both
plaintext and c-style comment form.

Please remember to change configure.ac to have details of YOUR package.
